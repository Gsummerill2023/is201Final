    <h4> ABOUT ME - George Summerill</h4>

    <p>I am currently a student at BYU. I studied in the pre-animation major for the past two years and I loved 
        everything that I learned. Although over the past semester I had the opportunity to take some business classes
        and I felt a pull to study business. I currently am an ametuer pickleball player and my mens doubles partner
        and I are training to debut in the professional league this upcoming year. We train every morning from 6-7:45AM
        and play in a 4.0 League every thursday. We have taken Bronze and Silver in the Pleasant Grove 3.0 division
        tournaments over the past 2 months and 5th in the 3.5 Annual Brigham City pickleball tournament. We plan to 
        play 4.5 division tournaments by the end of the summer and 5.0 by the end of the year. My family is from
        Hawaii and I love the beach as well!
